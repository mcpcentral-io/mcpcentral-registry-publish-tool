# MCP Registry Publisher

This repository contains the tools and documentation for publishing your MCP server to the registry.

There are two ways to publish your server:

1.  **Publish by Commit:** This is the recommended method. It allows you to publish your server by simply committing a `mcp-server.json` file to your repository. This is a seamless, Git-based workflow that doesn't require any special tools.

    [Learn more in the Publish-by-Commit Guide](./PublishByCommitGuide.md)

2.  **Submit a Server Tool:** This method uses a pre-compiled command-line tool to publish your server. This is a good option if you prefer not to use the Git-based workflow.

    [Learn more in the Submit a Server Guide](./SubmitAServerGuide.md)

3.  **Clone and Run:** For developers who prefer to work directly with the source code, you can clone this repository and run the publisher tool from the command line.
